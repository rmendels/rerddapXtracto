Title: Extracts Environmental Data from ERD's ERDDAP Web Service
Version: 0.3.0
Authors@R: person("Roy", "Mendelssohn", email = "roy.mendelssohn@noaa.gov", role = c("aut","cre"))
Description: The xtractomatic package contains three functions that access
    environmental data from ERD's ERDDAP service. The rxtracto function extracts
    data along a trajectory for a given "radius" around the point. The
    rxtracto_3D function extracts data in a box. The rxtractogon function
    extracts data in a polygon. There are also two helper functions to obtain
    information about available data.
    These functions differ from those in the xtractomatic package in that they
    use the `rerddap` package to access gridded data on any ERDDAP server, but
    they require the user to provide initial information about the data
    to be extracted.
